the order of app.use matters!.
for Passport if req.user was to be used before the passport is deserialized and serialized and other formalities, req.user will always show undeifned 
on all the templates.


BUT THE specific order of app.use is also important as we can see that uf we declare app.use((req,res,next)) before the routes for campground,user and
reviews, currentUser will show undefined and an error will occur.
THEREFORE it is very important to maintain order or else unexpected erros will oocur



req.session.returnTo: it is only there if the user frist go somewhere and then he is asked to login
